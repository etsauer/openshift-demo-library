# Demo (or Lab) of a Container Image Supply Chain in OpenShift

The intent of this demo is to represent how an Operations or Middleware Ops team can centrally manage an organization standard set of container images, and automatically roll out patches to running applications that are consuming those images. For the purpose of speed and simplicity, this demo uses the `cake-php-mysql-ephemeral` that ships with OpenShift Container Platform.

This content can be run purely as a demo (Presenter does everything while audience watches) or as a hands on Lab where the audience gets to log into the demo cluster and play the part of Application Development Teams.
